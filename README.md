squares_needed.rb

## Inject ##

## How to Use ##
Use in the irb:

## Takeaways ##
When needing a counter for recursion, you can pass it as an argument into the method, initiated as whatever you need the first value to be.
Some codewars solutions suggested different, and more concise, answers, but without recursion which was my aim when completing these kata.
